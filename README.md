## Overview

The Terraform workflow in this repository follows best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and leverages the power of Terraform to create, update, and destroy infrastructure resources. The workflow is organized into modular components for better maintainability and reusability.

## Workflow Steps

The Terraform workflow consists of the following high-level steps:

1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory with Terraform configurations.

2. **Plan Infrastructure Changes:**
   - Run `terraform plan` to generate an execution plan that describes what Terraform will do to reach the desired state.

3. **Apply Infrastructure Changes:**
   - Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and provision or update the infrastructure.

4. **Destroy Resources (Optional):**
   - If needed, run `terraform destroy` to destroy the infrastructure resources.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Terraform workflow, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Terraform Installed:** Install Terraform on your machine. Refer to [Terraform Installation Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for instructions.

- **Cloud Provider Credentials:** Configure credentials for the target cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) with the necessary permissions.

- **Variable Configuration:** Update the required variables in the Terraform configurations or provide them via environment variables.

## Usage

To use the Terraform workflow, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BellyBista/terraform-workflow.git
   cd terraform-workflow
